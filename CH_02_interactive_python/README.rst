Chapter 2 - interactive python
=======================================================================================================================

1. The `rlcompleter` enhancement we created currently only handles dictionaries. Try and extend the code so it supports lists, strings, and tuples as well.
2. Add colors to the completer (hint: use `colorama` for the coloring).
3. Instead of manually completing using our own object introspection, try and use the `jedi` library for autocompletion, which does static code analysis.
4. Try to create a `Hello` `<ipywidget>` so the name of the person can be edited through a notebook without code changes.
5. Try and create a script that will look for a given pattern through all of your previous ipython sessions.
